### Hi there!
I primarily contribute to the MediaWiki software (that's what powers Wikipedia) in various ways, as well as ~~exploiting~~ using the MediaWiki API to do things that may or may not be classified as "cool".

You can find my Wikimedia account (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JJPMaster)[here], and my Uncyclopedia account [https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/User:JJPMaster](here).

####What about languages?
I primarily work with Python and JavaScript (especially Node.JS), but sometimes you may catch me using PHP, Ruby, or maybe even C#!

####Finally...
I play [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)](Celeste), if you weren't able to tell that by my profile picture.

Okay, ***bye!***
